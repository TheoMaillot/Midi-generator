## 🎵 MIDI Melody Generator

### 📌 **Description**
This project is a **MIDI Melody Generator** built with Python. It allows users to create random MIDI melodies based on customizable parameters, such as musical scale, key, rhythm, and melodic complexity. The generated melodies can be exported as `.mid` files for further use in digital audio workstations (DAWs) or music projects.

### ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
The melodies generated by this tool are **randomly created**. They are not guaranteed to be musically pleasing or directly usable in a professional context. Think of this tool as an experimental generator or a creative starting point rather than a polished composition tool.

### 🛠️ **How It Works**
1. **Choose Parameters:** Select a scale, key, minimum and maximum pitch range, number of measures, and rhythmic generators.
2. **Adjust Complexity:** Fine-tune melodic complexity using a slider.
3. **Generate Melody:** Click the "Export MIDI File" button to save the generated melody.
4. **Explore Variations:** Tweak the parameters and regenerate for different outcomes.

### 📂 **Output**
The generated MIDI file can be saved in a user-specified directory and opened in most MIDI-compatible software.

### 🚀 **Dependencies**
- `tkinter`
- `mido`
- `music21`
- `ttkbootstrap`

Make sure these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the program.

### 📖 **Usage**
Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions to generate your unique melodies.

### 💡 **Future Improvements**
- Enhanced melody logic for better musicality.
- Predefined templates for melody generation.

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!

🎧 *Happy composing!* 🎹✨
